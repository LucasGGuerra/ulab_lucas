#Problem Number 1

#1.1: Use the command print working directory.
#1.2: ls lists the names of all the non-hidden directories and files
#1.3: cat [name of the file] allows you to edit the file specified
#1.4: nano [name of the file] allows you to read the text
#1.5: What do you mean see the difference? See the difference as in comparing the two files' contents or names?
#1.6: cp "patterns.txt" ~./math/calculus/
#1.7: rm ~/math/calculus/triangle.txt
#1.8: Music is not specified in this question, but I believe the correct command to call would be cd ~/math
#1.9: git add math
#1.10: git add math?
#1.11: cp "symmetry.txt" ..~/math
#1.12: git status, git won't show you tracking a new file until it has already been committed. 
#1.13: git add "symmetry.txt, git add ..
#1.14: run git status and check if it is waiting to be committed. git restore --staged [file path]
#1.15 git commit
#1.16 git push origin [branch you are pushing] You want to push to your local branch otherwise it will overrite your files in a different branch with the files staged in the branch you are working in
#1.17 git branch applied_math
#1.18 git checkout applied_math
#1.19 git add, git commit, git push origin applied_math. If you commit to the wrong branch you overrite the files in the other branch with the files staged in this one.
#1.20 git branch, your current working branch will be highlighted
#1.21 git checkout [main or master]
#1.22
